Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My website is about my group of friends living in a shed in the mountains in Austria, just kicking back and hanging loose.
I tried to make the website as good looking as possible. The main goal of the website was however for me to try and use 
all the tools explained in the first two CS50W lectures. I learned a lot!

* 	The website contains the following four .html pages (all accessable through the side menu)
		- index.html
		- crew.html
		- pics.html
		- news.html

* 	Unordered lists: side bar and in news.html
	Table: in crew.html
	Images: in pics.html

*	The style of the website can be found in styles.css 

*	More than 5 css properties are used in styles.css
	More than 5 types of CSS selectors (incl #id and .class) are used in styles.css

*	@media is used to move the side navigation menu to the top of the content for smaller screens

*	Boot strap comoponent used: button
	Bootstrap grid used in different ways in index.html, news.html and pics.html

*	The background color of the sidebar and header is defined as SCSS variable
	SCSS nesting is used for the table styling and for h2 in #content
	SCSS inheritence is used in news.html
